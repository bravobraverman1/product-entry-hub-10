# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: .env File Configuration

## What Changed?

The `.env` file has been **removed from version control** for security and flexibility reasons.

### Why?

1. **Security**: The `.env` file contains project-specific credentials that should never be committed
2. **Flexibility**: Each user/deployment should configure their own Supabase project
3. **No More Hardcoded Values**: The old hardcoded project ID has been removed

### What Do I Need to Do?

**If you're setting up the project for the first time:**

Simply run the automated setup script:
```bash
npm run setup
```

This will create your `.env` file with your Supabase credentials.

**If you're upgrading from an older version:**

Your existing `.env` file will continue to work, but:
- It's no longer tracked by git (as it should be)
- You should verify the values are correct
- Run `npm run setup` if you want to reconfigure

**If you're cloning this repository:**

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run setup`
3. Follow the prompts to enter your Supabase credentials

### Template

If you prefer manual setup, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your credentials
```

See **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** for detailed instructions.

## Migration from Old Setup

**Old way (hardcoded):**
- Project ID was hardcoded in multiple files
- `.env` was committed to git
- Changing projects required code edits

**New way (flexible):**
- No hardcoded values in code
- `.env` is generated by setup script
- Each user configures their own project
- Much more secure!

## For Developers

If you're working on this codebase:

1. **Never commit** your `.env` file
2. Use `.env.example` to show what variables are needed
3. Update documentation if you add new environment variables
4. Test the setup script after making changes
