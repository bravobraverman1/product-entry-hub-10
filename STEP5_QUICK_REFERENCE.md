## Prerequisites

You should have already completed:
- [x] STEP 1: Created Google Service Account
- [x] STEP 2: Shared your Google Sheet with the service account

   - Or reset it: Settings → Database → Reset password

### Add Secrets to GitHub

2. Click **Settings** (top navigation)
3. Click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** (left sidebar)

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Shows Red ❌

**Check your GitHub Secrets:**
- Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Verify all three secrets are present and correct:
  - `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (starts with `sbp_`)
  - `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` (your project ID)
  - `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` (your database password)

**If incorrect, update them and run the workflow again.**

### Test Connection Fails

**Clear your browser cache:**
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
- Reload the Admin page
- Click "Test Connection" again

**If still failing:**
- Verify service account email has Editor access to your Google Sheet
- Check Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Logs for errors

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to run this workflow every time I use the app?**  
A: No! Run it once, then your connection stays active.

**Q: Is my data safe?**  
A: Yes! GitHub Secrets are encrypted. No credentials are exposed in logs.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**  
A: Just run the workflow again. It's completely safe to repeat.

**Q: Do I need Supabase CLI installed?**  
A: No! GitHub Actions handles everything for you.

**Q: Can I use my browser-based credentials instead?**  
A: Yes! If you used Option A (browser-based config in STEP 3), you don't need this workflow. Skip it entirely.
